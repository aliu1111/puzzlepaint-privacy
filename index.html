    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App itself does not collect, store, or share any personal information about users.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of the Advertising ID</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To display ads relevant to user interests.</li>
      <li>To measure ad performance and improve ad quality.</li>
      <li>To limit the frequency of repeated ads.</li>
